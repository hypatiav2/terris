              <div class="panel">
                <p>
                  A stemathon is like a hackathon but with a wider range of fields—for the first iteration of the event, we will be covering two tracks—one in research and one in product design.
                </p>
              </div>

              <button class="accordion">How will the research track work? What will it focus on?</button>
              <div class="panel">
                <p>
                  There will be two options within our research track which you can choose to follow. One is a research paper where we will have mentors/professors guide you in writing a research paper. This guidance will be provided via specific office hours, Discord discussions, or workshops. The other option will allow you to create your own research proposal. Both of these options will have you working with and learning from specialized professors. 
                </p>
              </div>

              <button class="accordion">How will the product design track work? What will it focus on?</button>
              <div class="panel">
                <p>
                  The product design track will include CS elements and/or engineering elements. It’s a lot like a hackathon where you will be able to submit a project or program that you created whether it be a game, website, physical prototype, or other product of your creation!
                </p>
              </div>

              <div class="panel">
                <p>
                  We will be putting our schedule, Zoom links, and project submissions all on this live site!
                </p>
              </div>
              <button class="accordion">Does this competition cost anything?</button>
              <div class="panel">
                <p>
                  No! This event is completely free; all costs are covered.

              </div>
              <button class="accordion">What if I don’t know anything about research, coding, or engineering?</button>
              <div class="panel">
                <p>
                  That’s okay! There will be a variety of workshops where you can learn from mentors who are specialized in that area of interest. No experience is necessary, all you need is an interest in the subject!
                </p>
              </div>
              <button class="accordion">How do I form a team or join a team?</button>
              <div class="panel">
                <p>
                  At the beginning of the 2-week challenge, there will be a space on Discord for you to meet new people and team up with people around the world, if you do not wish to form a team from people you know. Each team may only have a maximum of four members.
                </p>

              <div class="panel">
                <p>
                  Each group will submit one submission for their entire group. The submission location will be on the website—it will include the names of the team members, the github link, and the video to your pitch. Optional questions may include the responsibilities of the team members and the team dynamic.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Zoom - Zoom is where we’re hosting the majority of our events. All Zoom events would be marked with the tag “Zoom” on our schedules, along with the link to the Zoom.
                  <br>Download Zoom <a href = "https://zoom.us/download">here</a> if you haven’t already done so!
                  <br>Discord - Discord is where we will have community bonding events, like game tournaments and little discussions. We will also be reminding you of Zoom meetings here. It is also where you can find potential teammates!

                <p>
                  Workshops video links will be posted on YouTube if the presenter is willing to and we will link it in the schedule!
                  <br> Meetings that will not be recorded will be tagged as “not recorded” on our schedule.

                <p>
                  If you miss a workshop, see the above question. As long as you registered for the workshop, you should have full access to the recording, so that you can watch it at any time!
                  <br> If you are unable to video conference or audio call a mentor, please private message any mentor with the “PM” role on Discord, as these are mentors who have indicated that they are comfortable with being privately messaged and working with attendees outside of their office hours. They will be able to establish communications with you via email or Discord messaging, depending on what is easier for them.
                  <br>However, because they are volunteering to do work outside of their designated office hours, please be respectful of their time and do not spam them with questions. 
                  <br>Please also be considerate of any time zone differences and do not contact a mentor at an inappropriate hour in their time zone. (Their time zone should be one of their roles on Discord.)
                  <br>When contacting a mentor outside of their office, please do not expect an immediate response (give them 3-5 hours to respond).
